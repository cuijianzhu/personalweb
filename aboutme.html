                      </header>
                      <p>Year 2000 marks the commencement of a new stage in my life. With curiosity and excitement, I left my hometown and went to the <a href="http://en.ustc.edu.cn/">University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)</a>. Campus life was far more diverse than I had anticipated. While many buddies were busy with dining, dating and gaming, I was obsessed with exotic hobbies like programming and wandering about tech forums. </p>

                      </header>
                      <p>In year 2003, I participated a student exchange program, and spent a semester a the <a href="http://www.ust.hk/">Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)</a>, a very young but well respected school. This was my first time to Hong Kong. Since then, my career has been bound to this fascinating city. During these four months, I took the course of computer vision, given by Prof. Quan Long.</p>

                      </header>
                      <p>After graduating from USTC, I chose to continue my academic pursuit at the <a href="http://www.cuhk.edu.hk/">Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK)</a>. I joined the <a href="http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/">Multimedia Lab</a> directed by Prof. Xiaou Tang, where I got exposed to various areas of computer vision and machine learning. Here, I began to publish papers, write blogs, and contribute to open source projects. I got very lucky in these years. I had 13 papers accepted to major CV conferences from 2005 to 2006, and eventually got the offer from MIT on the Valentine's day in 2007.</p>

                      </header>
                      <p>In a sunny day of 2007 summer, I boarded a plane towards my dream school, <a href="http://web.mit.edu/">Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)</a>. However, my excitment was quickly washed out by the heavy coursework. It was told that I can only pick two out of 3S: study, sleep, and social life; and that was almost true. At MIT, I worked with Prof. Eric Grimson, John Fisher, and Alan Willsky. I did not publish as often. Instead, I went deeper, which turned out to be very rewarding. In this course, my focus was gradually switched from computer vision to Bayesian statistics.</p>

                      </header>
                      <p>Saying goodbye to MIT, I moved to Chicago and joined <a href="http://www.ttic.edu/">Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago (TTIC)</a> as a research assistant professor. TTIC is a philanthropically endowed institute, dedicated to basic research in computer science. Being completely independent, I have a lot of freedom. This also comes with responsibility: I have to set up research agenda, establish collaboration with other professors, and arrange academic visits, all on my own. Thanks to Prof. Raquel Urtasun and Sanja Fidler, their help made my life a lot easier.</p>

                      <p>I returned to <a href="http://www.cuhk.edu.hk/">CUHK</a> in 2014, and joined the department of Information Engineering as a tenure-tracked Assistant Professor. I am looking forward to the way ahead, which, I believe, is filled with challenges and possibilities. I wish that there would be a more fascinating story to share in the next ten years.</p>
